# Statistical Thrust Estimation Using ADS-B Data, Machine Learning, Optimization, Aerodynamics and the Aircraft Noise Performance Database

*Abstract:* Current aircrat operations noise modelling relies on the use of pre-defined vertical profiles (altitude vs. distance) to produce noise contours.
Altough computationally inexpensive this approach leads to noise contours that are not based in actual flight trajectories.
In this work we propose the use of real vertical profiles (obtained from ADS-B data) to obtain aircraft noise modelling parameters (like thrust, weight, flap
configuration, etc.) by performing an advanced curve fitting algorigthm similar to that introduced by Yang et. al. on Mathematical Programming for Piecewise 
Linear Regression Analysis (2016). We run a multi-objective optimization on the aerodynamic equations presented in Appendix B of ECAC, Doc 29: 4th Edition, Volume 2, 2016.
where the loss is the quadratic difference between the estimated vertical profile and Calibrated Airspeed vs the ADS-B measured profile and Calibrated airspeed. 
A key contribution of this work is the ability to robustly identifiy if an aircraft is climbing, accelerating, levelling or descending using noisy ADS-B data.
